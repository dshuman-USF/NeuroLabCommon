	* ogl_sb.c: When running apps using openGL over the network (like in x2go),
	the get-a-framebuffer function fails. However, if you get a list of
	available framebuffers and use the first one, it appears to work.

2017-10-26  Dale Shuman  <dshuman@cisc1>

	* xsbf.c: the len param was not used in gopen and gopen3d calls. Some of
	the fortran callers were lucky that the title string was in memory that had
	a zero in it. The fireworks program was not so lucky and giberish was
	printed. The gravity_gui program needs the window title for the screen cap
	function. Dup the code in the ogl_sb to use len.

2017-10-18  Dale Shuman  <dshuman@cisc1>

	* ogl_sb.c: 
		clear_view_surface(...): Add in check for CLEAR_VIEWPORT. It now erases
	   some stray pixels at the top of the screen when rotating some 3d plots.
		gopen3d(...): Set size hints to not allow window resize. Sometimes users
		resize windows and it erases everything, but there is no code to repaint
		the window.  
		I wonder what these changes may break. . .

	* ogl_sb.c (write_png): change png_infopp_NULL to NULL due to

2014-06-10  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	* ps_starbase.c:
	(maybe_stroke, ps_draw2d): If a color change comes in the middle
	of a line, save the coordinates, do a 'stroke', then do a 'moveto'
	to the saved coordinates before the next 'lineto'.  Fixes broken
	.ps file on print or write.

2014-03-27  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	* postinst.template: added

2014-02-15  Russell O'Connor  <roconnor@health.usf.edu>

	(ps_rectangle, ps_move2d, ps_text2d, ps_append_text, ps_direct):
	integrate pslinemerge.pl into the Postscript generation code, so
	pslinemerge.pl is no longer necessary.
